Winston
=======

##### Equipment state tracking, but not annoying.

Winston is lightweight, performant, and most importantly, easily consumed.
Work with your org's equipment data with sanity - JSON and REST are what Winston speaks.

However, if you ever need to recall all your equipment out of concern for the welfare of the world, 
please be advised that Winston cannot physically compel it to return. That's all you.

## Usage Documentation

Haha, about that...

Look, I'm working on it - documentation to come as this thing actually gets built.

As it is, check out stuff under `$HOST_PREFIX/items`...

For example:
```
http://localhost:8080/items/by/id?id=4
http://localhost:8080/items/all
http://localhost:8080/items/by/name?name=Microsoft
http://localhost:8080/items/by/id?id=42
```

You might be thinking, "_Dude, that is NOT how you write a REST API_", and to that I say,
"_How virtuous of you to notice, it's almost as if this project is still in development._"
